Inside you will find the following files:
1. dbSetup.java - contains your username and password for connecting to the database
2. jdbcpostgreSQL.java - opens a connection to the database and runs a simple query that outputs to the terminal
3. jdbcpostgreSQLGUI.java - opens a connection to the database and runs a simple query that is displayed in a GUI
4. postgresql-42.2.8.jar - supports the database connection


You need to change the following things:
1. Edit dbSetup.java to contain your username and password. If you don’t want your credentials in plain-text, remove the .java file after you compile and create the .class file.
2. Edit jdbcpostgreSQL.java and jddbcpostgreSQLGUI.java to connect to your database.


To run:
Compilation:
javac *.java

Then run the following:
java -cp “.;postgresql-42.2.8.jar” jdbcpostgreSQL
java -cp “.;postgresql-42.2.8.jar” jdbcpostgreSQLGUI
Note, if you are using a mac, use a “:” instead of a “;” in the commands above.
